# PaulTorColorFunctions
Using Paul Tor's color scheme notes, I put them into functions that I could call when processing data so I didn't have to keep doing it manually.
This file includes an example dataset, and a main file to show how to call the three functions

The three functions include:
1. PaulTor_Qual(Colorset)
2. PaulTor_Div(Colorset)
3. PaulTor_Rainbow(N)
